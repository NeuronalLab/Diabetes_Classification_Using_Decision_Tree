In this Repo, we explore a machine learning technique called Decision Trees to identify potential diabetes patients. We’ll guide you through a data-driven journey, analyzing key factors such as gender, age, hypertension, heart diseases, smoking history, and blood glucose levels. Discover how these variables intertwine to form a robust prediction model that can revolutionize diabetes diagnosis and management. Don’t miss out on this insightful exploration – tune in now to empower your healthcare decisions with the science of prediction!
